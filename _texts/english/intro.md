text: "<p>The Ethical Roadmap is a tool we have developed within the EPSRC funded project Enabling Ongoingness to support researchers in navigating the ethical process.</p>

<p>Any moral framework, by its very nature, will be general and broad. Therefore in order to support the understanding of the process within the specific context of research across disciplines, we have created a series of resources. We offer the opportunity for different teams to add content to roadmap in a shared platform and appropriate the ethical roadmap from the specific needs of their research content. In that way, we design a living document that aims to bring the welfare of participants and researchers is at the heart of the process in different contexts.</p>

<p>The guidance in this road-map is ordered logically starting with research team activities, leading to activities that involve critical friends and research participants. For example, the value, moral quality and provocation cards will help to ground your study and to offer an overview of the broader issues and some of the practicalities as they arise.  Click on each resource below to find out more about each activity.</p>"
