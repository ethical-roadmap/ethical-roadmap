      - We have developed a set of <strong>moral quality cards</strong>, inspired by the ‘Ethical Framework for the Counselling Professions (BACP)’, but developed to fit more a design research context.
      - Reflect on the qualities described on the card and define these in your own words. Now turn the cards over and see if your definition corresponds to that on the back of the card. As you come together as a team use the cards as talking points to identify those qualities you feel that you possess and qualities you would like to develop further.

      - 'You will find 4 provocation cards with questions such as: <strong>What will empathy be in action? What will participation be in action?</strong> As a team, explore what these mean to you within the context of your project. Can you use the moral quality cards as a response to these questions?'

      -  Finally look at ways you can support each other to build confidence in areas through socialisation and shadowing for example.

      - As you are facilitating activities, it's important that another team member is in charge of capturing the discussions and decisions.
      - 'For the moral quality activities we have enclosed 2 worksheets to help in capturing an overview that can be referred to throughout your project:'
      - <strong> Qualities I possess... </strong>
      - <strong> In action... </strong>
      - We suggest that you revisit and adjust your captured notes at every key team meeting to remind and realign the team, You can also re-run the activities to establish changes as a project progresses.
