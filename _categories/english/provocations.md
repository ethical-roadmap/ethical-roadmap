      - The purpose of the provocation cards is to start discussions between the team members on ethical concerns or issues arising from working with potentially vulnerable groups of participants. The selected provocation cards may make team members think about the research context more broadly and/or align new members with the thinking and values of the existing team. Think about them as “wild cards” in games.

    text: 
      - Pick up a card and discuss it with your team at any point of the research programme. Try and find some common ground in the situations described in the cards. What would you do? How would you tackle the issue?
      - "The cards are divided in four categories:"
      - Technology
      - Sense of Self
      - Relationship between researchers and participants
      - Relationships between family members
      - If you find that your team is quite technology minded, you might want to choose a different section of the pack to challenge thinking.

    - The prompt cards work well with the value cards and when discussing what we can and cannot do within a research project. We’ve enclosed another one of these worksheets to help capture discussions.

      - "As you are facilitating the activities, it’s important that another team member is in charge of capturing the discussions and decisions. For the provocation activities we have enclosed 1 worksheet to help in capturing an overview that can be referred to throughout your project:"
      - We can/ we cannot
      - We suggest that you revisit and adjust your captured notes at every key team meeting to remind and realign the team. You can also re-run the activities to establish changes as a project progresses.
