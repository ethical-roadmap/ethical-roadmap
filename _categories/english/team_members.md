      - "You are aiming to establish a core research team who are all going in the same direction based on a shared vision and values. Many research projects focus on the skills that individuals bring without considering whether team members have a compatible vision and values. This X invites you to dedicate time exploring together the philosophies and values that you share. Inspired by Belbin’s and Kelly’s research, contained in this resource is:"
      - A team member role map
      - Team member role cards, containing qualities and values of the role
      - Team member traits (animal cards)
      - Conversations at an early point will help to avoid conflict later in the process particularly if you also agree processes to resolve challenges and the mechanisms that might help support with this process.

      - Turn the cards so that the desription is facing you. Ask team members to identify which description they most relate to. Note down the number. Is there a second card that team members can relate to?
      - Turn the cards over and identify which roles you might be able to fill within this project. Using the Team Member Role Map you can make a note of where people fit within the framework and identify any gaps that you might have.
      - "Questions you may wish to ask at this point in the process:"
      - Do we have a good spread of roles?
      - Are there any gaps that we might need to fill?
      - How can we ensure that we continue to align to these roles?

      - We all have different traits as individuals. It’s good to understand different personalities through our traits. One way to do this is through using the animal cards. Spread the cards out and ask the team members to identify which animal they can relate to. For example, the puppy is a loyal animal that is also very energetic, whilst the tortoise is an animal that takes his time, is considered but can win the race.
  - title: Capture
    text: 
    - As you are facilitating the activities, it’s important that another team member is in charge of capturing the discussions and decisions.
    - "For the team member role activities we have enclosed 3 worksheets to help in capturing an overview and to consider strategies for resolving conflict within the team:"
    - Team Member Role Map
    - I am...
    - Resolving challenges
    - We suggest that you revisit and adjust your captured notes at every key team meeting to remind and realign the team. You can also re-run the activities to establish changes as a project progresses.
