  I am currently doing a PhD in Neuroscience at University College London. I
  study the brain to understand how different areas “talk” to each other and how
  this conversation can go wrong in disease.

  My name is Rawan AlSubaie, I am from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. I studied my
  undergraduate in biomedical science at the university of Sheffield and
  completed my masters degree in neuroscience at King’s College London. After
  completing these degrees I worked in Saudi Arabia at the King Abdullah
  International Medical Research Centre (KAIMRC) in neurogenetics and as a
  research specialist at King Fahad Medical City (KFMC).


  My experience in science has taught me a lot, including both technical and
  personal skills. As a neuroscientist, you are trained (or you train yourself)
  well in handling data and analysing it using statistics, modelling and machine
  learning. As well as, managing yourself and your own project, which are all
  valuable skills for the work place – even if you don’t want a career in
  academia.
