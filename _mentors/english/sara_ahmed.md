  I am UX Specialist, which is a very new an exciting work area to be in. User
  Experience isn't one job or only designer as many think it is. UX is a process
  of designing a product, commonly digital product such as mobile application,
  eCommerce and wearable devices.

  To be a professional in this field, I studied aboard and got a MS degree in
  Human Computer Interaction (HCI). HCI is a fun major encompasses multiple
  disciplines, such as computer science, cognitive science, and human-factors
  engineering. I love my job and I love to help anyone has interest to join the
  field.
