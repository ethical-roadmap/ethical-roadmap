  Because I care, being professional and precise in work are my top priorities.
  I have worked as a UX architect, designer, and an analyst in the eCommerce
  field, and now I am helping the digital transformation in the insurance
  industry in Saudi Arabia. Holding an MS degree in HCI makes me passionate to
  raise the awareness and spread the knowledge about user experience in the
  sociality, and especially among the entrepreneurs which their business relies
  on digital products.


  If I want to summarize Lujayn in three words I will say: CARE, PASSION, and
  SMILE
