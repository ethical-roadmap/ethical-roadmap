  I’m a geneticist in the Cheung Lab at the University of Michigan. I’m
  interested in the role of RNA in regulating gene expression. My long-term
  goals are to make significant contributions to the field of genetics and to
  mitigate racial and gender disparity in STEM fields.

  I’m currently a geneticist in a research lab at the University of Michigan. I
  completed my Master’s in Genetics and Genomics at Iowa State University in the
  US and I will be starting my PhD in Oncology at Oxford University in October
  2019 as the first Saudi Arabian Rhodes Scholar, God willing. I have been
  actively doing research for about three years now and have written three
  scientific papers. During my undergraduate studies in Saudi Arabia, I
  unfortunately was not taught about or exposed to many research opportunities.
  By participating in this project, I hope to expand the number of young Saudi
  women engaged in scientific research.
